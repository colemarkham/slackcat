# Installation
The lambda branch can be deployed as an AWS Lambda function. After the Lamda function is configured, see the instructions for setting up an API Gateway: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-chatbot-sample.

Once the service is deployed, configure an outgoing webhook in Slack to point at your URL.
